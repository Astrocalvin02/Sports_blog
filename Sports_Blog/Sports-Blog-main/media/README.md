# Media Directory

This directory stores all user-uploaded media files including:

- Post featured images (stored in posts/YEAR/MONTH/DAY/)
- User profile pictures (stored in profile_pics/)

This directory is automatically managed by Django when users upload files through the application.

Note: This README file is just a placeholder to ensure the media directory is created and tracked in version control.
